## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-28

Initial release.

### Added
- `RateEngine` with `price_now()`, `price_at()`, and `forecast()` for PG&E
  E-ELEC import prices and NEM 3.0 / Net Billing Tariff export credits.
- Vendored rate data for all five NBT vintages (NBT23/24/25/26/00), collapsed
  from PG&E's ~40 MB-per-vintage hourly files to 268 KiB total with verified
  lossless round-tripping.
- ACC Plus adder as a first-class, separately reported component.
- CCA / Direct Access support: bundled generation and PCIA are dropped, and
  delivery-only prices are flagged `complete=False` rather than understated.
- CLI: `now`, `forecast`, `info`, `mqtt`, `serve`.
- MQTT publisher with Home Assistant MQTT Discovery and a last-will
  availability topic.
- FastAPI service under the `web` extra.
- HACS-installable Home Assistant custom component.
- `tools/regen_data.py` for refreshing vendored data, plus a weekly CI job that
  fails when upstream rates change.

### Notes on upstream data
- PG&E's export files label the repeated 01:00 on the autumn DST transition as
  `HS2`, so that hour is priced as 2am. Handled in `timeutil.export_hour`.
- From 2036 onward PG&E's own hour labels stop tracking Pacific daylight time
  and NBT25/26/00 duplicate some holidays onto the following day. The verified
  boundary is recorded per vintage as `exact_through` and surfaced as
  `ExportPrice.exact`. Every year within a nine-year rate lock is exact.
- Holiday calendars are extracted per vintage from the source data rather than
  recomputed, because the vintage files disagree in far-future years.
